We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars. - Carl Sagan

Long before Elon Musk picked up the torch, Carl Sagan was inspiring the masses to think about exploration beyond Earth. His 1980s show 'Cosmos' blew my mind. I actually named my dog 'Cosmos' after the documentary. I wish I met him when he was alive.

It's not just space out there. There are things so powerful and weird that they're kind of scary to me. When I first learnt about some of the things out there my gut felt really weird. One of my favourite things in the universe are quasars. I named my other dog Quasar by the way. We (i.e. humans) have found a quasar 1.5 BILLION times the mass of our Sun. Let that sink in. Something over a billion times heavier than our Sun. These things can be far more luminous than any galaxy. It still feels heavy for me to think about the existence of these things.

We know that there are probably plenty of inhabitable planets out there. There are almost definitely aliens. It's very likely that there are beings similar to us, living on a planet similar to ours, wondering if there are others out there. We really only have two options: Stay here, or start exploring. If we stay here all of the intelligent life in the known universe will die within a fixed timeframe. We already know this. It's simply a fact. If we spread out, it won't, and other worlds will be our playgrounds. I feel like we have a responsibility to ensure option 2 is the outcome.

I think it will be very difficult for us to inhabit another planet, but I also think that we will eventually develop the technology to do so. We've been around for about 200,000 years. I saw the internet become mainstream in the 90s. Personally, I think we're just getting started. I really hope that humanity takes option 2; exploration. Maybe someday, something that thinks and feels like me, will inhabit another planet. I find that amazing. I find that motivating. It's not a pipe dream; it's really possible.
